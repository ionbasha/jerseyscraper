# jerseyscraper
A Python program which collects data about the newest additions to some of my favourite football/soccer jersey reselling websites.

Utilizies Beautiful Soup framework to extract data from a few of my favourite jersey reselling websites. This data is then stored
into a database containing the name, URL and price of each jersey, using the MongoDB database program.

Ideally, this program is scheduled to run on a fixed schedule, scraping data and sending a system notification if any new additions
have been made to the database.
